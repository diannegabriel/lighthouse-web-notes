### Gists
What is a gist? It is another git repository.
Except it's smaller and used for sharing smaller snippets of code.
Gists cannot be given names.

### Fork
A fork is a GitHub operation.
Where a user creates their own copy of another GitHub's user's existing repository.
Forked repo links back to the original.
However the forked one is fully controllable by the user that created that fork.

git clone git@gist.github.com:YOUR_FORKS_ID.git lunch

git clone - command
git@gist.github.com:YOUR_FORKS_ID.git - SSH
lunch - directory name


### Recursion

To start figuring out how to solve a problem using recursion, it's helpful to first figure out the base case and the recursive case. 

The recursive case is when the function will continue to call itself. Every time the function calls itself, the input gets closer and closer to the base case.

The base case involves no calls to itself.

The base case is simply when the function doesn't make any recursive calls.

Packages are self-contained code libraries that we can install and use in our projects.
