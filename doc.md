### Recursion

To start figuring out how to solve a problem using recursion, it's helpful to first figure out the base case and the recursive case. 

The recursive case is when the function will continue to call itself. Every time the function calls itself, the input gets closer and closer to the base case.

The base case involves no calls to itself.

The base case is simply when the function doesn't make any recursive calls.

Packages are self-contained code libraries that we can install and use in our projects.
